    "Advocates:": "Ms Muruka Advocate, instructed by Kenya Revenue Authority for the Appellant, Mr Kimani, SC with him Mr Ruto instructed by Hamilton, Harrison and Mathews Advocates for he Respondent.",
    "Court Division:": "Commercial and Tax",
    "County:": "Nairobi",
    "Case Summary:": "For a service to be deemed an exported service, the determining factor was the location where that service was to be finally used or consumed.Brief factsThe respondent was a Kenyan limited liability company and the exclusive local and shipping agent of WEC Lines BV (WEC BV) a company incorporated in the Netherlands pursuant to an agency agreement dated January 1, 2009 (the agency agreement). WEC BV’s business consisted of maritime transportation of containerized goods to, from, or through territories and operated vessels calling at various ports in those territories. As WEC BV’s agent, the respondent was responsible for representing it in the daily operations related to WEC BV’s activities in Kenya. On various dates, the respondent made value-added tax (VAT) refund applications amounting to Kshs 6,440,624.00 for the income period February 2015 to January 2018 to the appellant (the Commissioner) on the basis that it was offering zero-rated services to WEC BV being exported services and supply of taxable services to international sea or air carriers on international voyage or flight. After considering the applications, the Commissioner informed the respondent that it had rejected the same after reviewing the agency agreement because from the agreement, the respondent was paid a commission and that the services offered by the respondent included solicitation of business, customer service, booking, documentation, quotation of rates, collection, administration and forwarding of claims. The Commissioner further cited regulation no. 13 of the VAT Regulations, 2017 in concluding that the respondent’s supplies did not qualify as exported services and as such were taxable at 16%. The respondent formally objected and the Commissioner in turn rendered its objection decision where it reaffirmed its earlier decision of rejecting the refund claims. The respondent was dissatisfied with that decision and lodged an appeal at the Tax Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal). The Tribunal allowed the respondent’s appeal and set aside the Commissioner’s objection decision subject to the Commissioner’s right to verify the respective refund claims before settling the same. Aggrieved by that decision, the Commissioner filed the instant appeal.IssuesWhether a service that was performed in Kenya for the benefit of a company in a foreign country was considered as an exported service.What amounted to matters of law which were to be dealt with by an appellate court?What was the effect of failure to table Regulations before Parliament within the required time? What was the nature of an agency relationship? HeldThe court was exercising appellate jurisdiction that was circumscribed by section 56(2) of the Tax Procedures Act (TPA) which provided that an appeal to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal would be on a question of law only. An appeal limited to matters of law did not permit the appellate court to substitute the Tribunal’s decision with its own conclusions based on its own analysis and appreciation of the facts.What amounted to matters of law were the interpretation or construction of the Constitution, statute or regulations made or their application to the sets of facts established by the trial court. The court’s engagement with the facts was limited to background and context and to satisfy itself, when the issue was raised, whether the conclusions of the trial court were based on the evidence on record or whether they were so perverse that no reasonable tribunal would have arrived at them. The court could not be drawn into considerations of the credibility of witnesses or which witnesses were more believable than others; by law that was the province of the trial court.When a court that was limited to dealing with matters of law had a concern regarding the issues that dealt on facts, then the court would also be limited to re-evaluation of the lower court’s conclusions and if the conclusions were erroneous and were not supported by evidence and the law, then the matter became a point of law.Section 11(4) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 2013, which provided that if a copy of a statutory instrument that was required to be laid before Parliament was not so laid in accordance with that section, the statutory instrument would cease to have effect immediately after the last day for it to be so laid but without prejudice to any act done under the statutory instrument before it became void, was mandatory and the consequence of failure to comply with the procedure rendered the VAT Regulations, 2017 void. That requirement was not idle as it was a manifestation of the legislative authority vested in Parliament under article 94 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (Constitution). More particularly, article 94(5) which provided that no person or body, other than Parliament had the power to make provision having the force of law in Kenya except under the authority conferred by the Constitution or legislation.Even if the VAT Regulations, 2017 had not been declared invalid, it was the affirmative duty of the court to give effect not only the Constitution but clear provisions of statute. The VAT Regulations, 2017 ceased to have any effect immediately on the 8th day after the Regulations were not tabled before the National Assembly. The Commissioner could not apply them to the respondent’s case as they were at the time null and void.The respondent was an agent of WEC BV and their relationship was governed by the agency agreement. As an agent, any contract or contact made by the respondent to a third party was essentially a contractual relationship between the principal and the third party and all actions by agents were deemed to be those of the principal.Agency was the fiduciary relationship which existed between two persons, one of whom expressly or impliedly manifested assent that the other should act on his behalf so as to affect his relations with third parties, and the other of whom similarly manifested assent so to act or so acted pursuant to the manifestation. The one on whose behalf the act or acts were to be done was called the principal. The one who was to act was called the agent. Any person other than the principal and the agent could be referred to as a third party.A general agent was an agent who had authority to act for his principal in all matters concerning a particular trade or business, or of a particular nature; or to do some act in the ordinary course of his trade, profession or business as an agent, on behalf of his principal. There was no privity of contract between the respondent and the importers of cargo who contract with the principal.The Commissioner had not pointed to any legal authority that displaced the ordinary principal/agent relationship. Therefore, the greatest beneficiary and consumer of the respondent’s services of marketing, customer care and post landing services was its principal WEC BV. It was WEC BV who would benefit from their business being marketed by the respondent. WEC BV would also be the beneficiary of good customer care relations and post landing services offered by the respondent as the respondent was offering those services on behalf of WEC BV and never contracted any third parties, customer and/or importers on its own behalf.Section 2 of the Value Added Tax Act, 2013, defined services exported out of Kenya as a service provided for use or consumption outside Kenya and for a service to be deemed an exported service, it did not matter whether that service was performed in Kenya or outside Kenya. The determining factor was the location where that service was to be finally used or consumed. WEC BV, a company incorporated in the Netherlands stood to benefit from the services offered by the respondent and the services offered by the respondent to them were exported services that were not consumed in Kenya and thus were zero-rated for purposes of VAT. The respondent having made zero-rated supplies was entitled to VAT refunds due to it.",

    "Case Summary:": "Extension of parental responsibility to pay school fees for a child above 18 years should not be stopped due to poor performance and indiscipline.Brief factsThe appellant instituted a suit against her husband, the respondent, at the trial court seeking among other orders; an extension of parental responsibility against the respondent in respect of MSS aged 20 years; a custody order requiring that legal custody, care and control of the issues of their marriage namely; MSS, NSS and ISS be awarded to the appellant; a maintenance order requiring the respondent to make periodic financial payment as the court deemed fit to the appellant in respect of the maintenance of the issues. During the pendency of the main suit, several applications were filed culminating in a number of rulings giving rise to various interlocutory orders.The trial court held that parental responsibility of NSS remained extended as per the orders of March 19, 2018 and further to the orders, the same orders would  end upon her attaining the age of 23 years unless the respondent extended them; parental responsibility against the respondent with regards to MSS was to stop upon delivery of the judgment; the respondent was to make a monthly contribution of KES 40,000 for the upkeep of ISS and NSS, deductible directly from the respondent’s pension account; and that the amount of KES 120, 000 being received by the appellant from the respondent’s pension account was to be stopped. Dissatisfied with the trial court’s judgment, the appellant filed the instant appeal. IssuesWhether an extension of parental responsibility to pay school fees for a child above 18 years could be terminated on account of poor performance and indiscipline of the child. Who qualified to apply for an extension of parental responsibility for a child? Whether the requirement to pay maintenance in a talak document could be subjected to change where necessary. What was the nature of interlocutory orders? Whether variation of interlocutory maintenance orders amounted to a court sitting as an appellate court in its own judgment. Relevant provisions of the lawChildren Act, 2001Section 28 - Extension of responsibility beyond eighteenth birthday(1)      Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child’s eighteenth birthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made:Provided that the order may be applied for after the child’s eighteenth birthday.(2)      An application under this section may be made by—(a) the parent or relative of a child;(b) any person who has parental responsibility for the child;(c) the Director;(d) the child. Section 91 - Power to make maintenance orderAny parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the maintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a “maintenance order,” as the court may see fit:Provided that—(a) on the making, varying, or discharging of a residence, guardianship or custody order, the court may make a maintenance order for a child even though no application has been made by any person;(b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for a maintenance order to be made in his favour in the following circumstances—(i)       The person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or(ii)      the person is disabled and requires specialised care which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or(iii)      the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or(iv)     other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order.HeldBeing a first appeal, the court had a duty to analyse and re-examine the evidence adduced in the trial court and reach its own conclusion while always bearing in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify and make allowance for that fact.Parental responsibility was defined under Part III, section 23(1) of the Children Act as all the duties, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority that by law a parent of a child had in relation to the child. Under section 2 of the Children Act, a child was referred to as any human being under the age of 18 years. Parents were under obligation to provide for their children and ensure that their rights under article 53 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (Constitution) and the Children Act were provided for.Article 53(1)(e) of the Constitution provided that, a child had the right to parental care and protection, which included equal responsibility of the mother and father to provide for the child, whether they were married to each other or not. As a general principle but in theory, when a child attained the age of 18 years, he or she was deemed to be independent and capable of doing his or her things and therefore no longer entitled to be provided for by the parents. Nevertheless, that was not the true position in real life as that was the age when such a child needed educational support.There were exceptions to the general rule to the extent that, parental responsibility in respect of a child who had attained the age of majority could be extended if the court was satisfied that special circumstances existed with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances were provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act. Section 91(b) of the Children Act provided for exceptional circumstances when a person who was not a child could apply to the court for a maintenance order.The court should not make orders in vain. Any and all interlocutory orders lapsed upon delivery of judgment after the full and final determination of a suit. The first order for the extension of parental responsibilities was an interlocutory order which was subject to change upon making orders in the final judgment. The trial court did not sit like an appellate court overturning its own decision when reviewing the orders in its final judgment. Interlocutory orders were by their very nature not final orders unless adopted as such by consent or arrived at by the court in its judgment.Since the court had already extended parental responsibility for MSS for purposes of finishing her studies, the trial court acted improperly and indeed in error by stopping further parental responsibility in terms of stopping payment of school fees by the respondent while fully aware that the respondent had partly contributed to non-completion of her studies in good time by withdrawing payment of school fees on account of the child’s indiscipline.In the circumstances, it was not in the best interests of the child to terminate her studies at the final stage. To that extent, the trial court wrongly exercised its discretion by stopping parental responsibility at the critical stage of a child’s career and future based on poor performance and indiscipline of the child. The benefits of completing her education far outweighed any other factor bearing in mind the money and time already spent vis a vis the outstanding amount and time remaining to complete her education. The good news however was, MSS had finished her studies and if there were any outstanding fees (arrears) or expenses, then, the respondent was under obligation to clear the same.If MSS had indeed finished college which was the main reason for the extension of parental responsibility in her favour, there would be nothing binding the respondent from further taking full parental responsibility against her unless a fresh application was made with sufficient reasons or grounds.The discretion to impose conditions attendant to the extension of parental responsibility purely lay with the trial court. In the instant case, the court considered the duration a degree course was likely to take to complete. To that extent, there was no irregularity or abuse of discretion in fixing time as a condition for extension of parental responsibility.Further extension of parental responsibilities should NSS for whatever reason including sickness fail to complete her education in time would only be done by the respondent. Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, any application for extension of parental responsibility could be made by the parent or relative of a child, any person who had parental responsibility for the child, the Director or the child.Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, the choice as to who was supposed to apply for an extension of parental responsibility was wide. By limiting those powers to the respondent alone, the trial court applied wrong principles in law by blocking any other person entitled in law not to apply for an extension of parental responsibility. Nevertheless, imposing time frames was meant to instill discipline and hard work in children while in school.It was not proper to give an open cheque for children to stay in school as long as they wanted yet after the age of 18 years, what a parent did for a child was a privilege that even the court could on its own motion grant or withdraw for good reason.The respondent was retired and of advanced age. The respondent received a monthly pension of KES. 120,000 from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and Kengen and had two other wives plus other children. All the companies to which the appellant used to be a director and/or partner were no longer operational hence there was no income that was derived from the companies. It was clear from the proceedings that there was a maintenance order made against the respondent to be paying a sum of KES. 120,000 out of his pension. That amount was based on the promise made under talak document in divorce proceedings that the respondent was to maintain the children.Upon the children attaining the age of majority and subsequent extension of parental responsibility, and upon them proceeding abroad for further studies, the cost of their maintenance shifted from home to their place of stay that was in college. It, therefore, meant that the cost of maintaining them was no longer required or applicable at home but in college which the respondent was incurring through payment of school fees and the attendant maintenance expenses.Pursuant to section 99 of the Children Act, a court had powers to impose conditions and to vary orders as it found appropriate. There was no parental responsibility agreement between the appellant and the respondent, and the talak document being relied on by the appellant was based on the respondent’s capability to provide for his children, which capability had substantially reduced unlike at the time he was giving the appellant talak. That was because he was retired and did not engage in any kind of gainful employment because of his advanced age.The respondent was under a duty to maintain children. In the absence of children, the appellant would not be entitled to anything. Therefore, the demand for a full amount of maintenance as it used to be when she was staying with the children full time was not tenable. Besides, the talak document had no specific monthly maintenance expenses.The talak document was dependent on the unmeasured and unspecified financial ability of the respondent. That did not stop the respondent from making his contribution to her children. The respondent was a human being with limited financial resources. He could not stretch beyond the limit. If he had been straining when paying school fees for three children and meeting other obligations, he could not continue doing so even when two of the children were out of Kenya a cost that was not envisaged in the calculation of maintenance.Under the Constitution, the maintenance of children was an equal parental responsibility. The fact that the respondent was to pay maintenance under the talak document, was subject to change if circumstances dictated. The change of circumstances included children insisting on studying abroad instead of in Kenya where the father was comfortable paying college fees. The appellant could not sit and watch her former husband perform every duty. The direction that the appellant had to meet some support obligations was not unlawful but constitutional.The appellant being a healthy person who was physically fit had to prove that she was doing her best to support her children when the father was overwhelmed. There was every justification for the trial court to vary the interlocutory maintenance order in her final judgment and that the variation did not amount to sitting as an appellate court in its own judgment. Parents needed to enjoy good health during their old age and not to live miserable lives on account of their children’s unlimited demands. One could not be a permanent child simply because there was a parent to provide forever. Children had to know that extension of parental responsibility was not absolute but a privilege accorded and sanctioned through the court and could be withdrawn any time by the court even suo motto.In every decision made by the court or any other person, the best interests of the child had to be taken into consideration. Parental care and protection were equally shared responsibilities of both parents. Shared responsibility presupposed ability. Section 94(1) of the Children Act stipulated the considerations by which the court would be guided when making an order for financial provision for the maintenance of a child.It was incumbent upon the appellant to prove or demonstrate to the court that in arriving at its decision, the court exhibited bias or violated her rights. Although the appellant had alleged discrimination on account of her sex, her role as a mother, financial status, and medical and educational status, no evidence was led to support such an inference. Section 108 of the Evidence Act provided that the burden of proof in a suit or procedure lay on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. Section 109 of the Evidence Act further provided that the burden of proof as to any particular fact lay on the person who wished the court to believe in its existence unless it was provided by any law that the proof of that fact should lay on any particular person.The appellant was duty-bound to prove the specific constitutional violations. It was not enough to state that the appellant’s constitutional rights were violated through discrimination. There was no violation of any constitutional right/s of the appellant nor discrimination by being told to wake up from the dependency bed to a more robust and supportive lifestyle. The burden to prove denial of her constitutional right purely lay in the hands of the appellant.An appellate court should be slow in interfering with the exercise of the discretion of a trial court. An appellate court could only tinker with a decision if it was satisfied that the discretion of that court was not exercised judiciously.",
